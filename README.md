# Vapiai Express Starter

Welcome to the Vapiai Express Starter project! This project is designed to kickstart your development with the Vapi SDK, a powerful tool for building Voice driven AI applications. For more information on Vapi, visit [Vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai).

## Project Overview

The Vapi Express Starter is a boilerplate setup that provides a foundational structure for your Vapi applications. It allows you to create a webhook which Vapi can use to send various messages. You can do implement functions here and they will be triggered via vapi. You can also do postprocessing once the call is complete or store the messages in the conversations. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn (as your package manager)

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.

### Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
# yarn
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see your Vapi application running and ready for development.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Deployment

Deploying your Vapi application can be done through various methods depending on your hosting provider. A general approach is as follows:

1. Build your application using the build command provided above.
2. Transfer the contents of the `dist/` directory to your server.
3. Start the server using a process manager like PM2, with `pm2 start dist/main.js`.

## Next Steps

After setting up your project, you might want to:

- Explore the Vapi SDK and integrate its features into your application.
- Set up a database to store and manage your application's data.
- Implement authentication and authorization for secure access to your application.
- Write unit and integration tests to ensure your application's reliability.
- Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate your build and deployment process.
